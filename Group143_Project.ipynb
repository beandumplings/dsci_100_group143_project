    "#### Background Information\n",
    "Chest pain (angina)¹ is the most obvious symptom of heart disease. High cholesterol and high blood pressure are major factors that induce chest pain because both affect coronary arteries that supply the heart with blood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has shown that high cholesterol causes accumulation on the artery walls, further reduces artery blood flow, and causes complications like chest pain². Also, high blood pressure damages arteries by reducing elasticity, which decreases blood and oxygen flow to the heart, and leads to chest pain³. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists define cholesterol level above 240 mg/dl as high and dangerous⁴, and systolic pressure (artery pressure when heart beats) above 130mmHg as hypertension³. Blood pressure in this project is systolic pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Description + Question we try to answer\n",
    "In our project, we use the Cleveland database in the UCI Heart Disease Data Set ([Kaggle link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci?resource=download)). It contains 14 attributes and information supported by Cleveland Clinic Foundation. We aim to predict chest pain type for heart disease patients from their blood pressure and cholesterol values."
